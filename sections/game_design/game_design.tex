As a student sponsored project, we were faced with some very unique
challenges. As a team we had to answer some very important questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What exactly is the problem we wish to solve?
    \item What is our solution to this problem?
\end{itemize}

We quickly recognized that finding good answers to these questions was imperative to the success of our project.
This section of the document will discuss our efforts in answering these fundamental questions.
