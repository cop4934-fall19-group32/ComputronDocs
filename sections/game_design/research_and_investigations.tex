In order to define a clear vision of what we wanted our project to be, we decided to consult research and conduct playtesting of similar games in order to inform the development of our prototypes. Once our prototypes were formed, we playtested them as well so that when we began coding the game, it would be with a clear and uniform vision in mind. The following section summarizes our findings throughout this process.
