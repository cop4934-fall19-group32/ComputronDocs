At the highest level, our game can be broken into 5 major systems that will work together to provide the experience we are hoping to create. These parts are The Engine, The Puzzle System, The User Interface, The Interpreter, and The Actor. The relationship between these systems has been designed to be as simple as possible. As shown in figure \ref{fig:overall_system_diagram}, each major system is only responsible for interfacing with two others.

The nature of these interfaces, as well as the operations, responsibilities, and requirements of each of these major systems will be detailed in subsequent sections.
