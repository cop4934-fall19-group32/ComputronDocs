\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Product will help users learn and understand foundational computer science 
		concepts
	\item Product will be a playable video game
	\item Game will have an easy to use 2D interface to encourage beginners
	\item Present the user with various challenges and puzzles to solve
	\item Provide beginner level explanations to concepts as they’re introduced
	\item Present visuals to help users understand concepts that are being
		introduced or applied
	\item Encourage user to apply concepts to solve subsequent challenges once it has
		been introduced
	\item Provide hints to user when requested
	\item Allow user to see their previous solution attempts for a level
	\item Help guide users towards an appropriate solution
	\item Break down complex challenges into smaller parts with guidance/checkpoints 
		for each main step
	\item Simulate the execution of player’s solutions with animated visuals
		corresponding to the steps
	\item Inform player of the accuracy of their solution
	\item Inform player of the efficiency of their solution
	\item Inform player of the (extremely simplified/generalized) space complexity of their solution
	\item Allow user to speed up the simulations if they are doing well with the
		current challenges
	\item Halt solution simulation in the case of:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Incorrect Output
		\item Invalid Instruction
		\item Error
		\end{itemize}
	\item Game will be scalable so additional levels/challenges can be added later on
	\item Interface will be suitable for users with certain common disabilities:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Color blindness
		\item Deafness
		\item Epilepsy
		\item Auditory stimuli sensitivities
		\end{itemize}
	\item No personally identifiable information about users will be intentionally 
		collected or stored
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Demonstrate concepts visually with 2D animations simulating the 
		execution of a user’s solution to a challenge
	\item Allow user to select levels/challenges
	\item Design a simple pseudo-language with restricted capabilities for the
		user to solve challenges
	\item Interpret the set of commands in a user’s solution
	\item Solutions must follow interpreter requirements in order to be simulated
		(similar to compile time errors)
	\item Solution simulation will detect errors and halt immediately if an error
		is encountered (similar to runtime errors)
	\item Store user’s solution attempts for a level
	\item Check if current solution attempt matches previous solution attempt
	\item Analyze patterns to detect infinite loop
	\item Track the steps taken to execute a solution
	\item Evaluate the space complexity of a solution by tracking the data
		structures used
%to avoid a list being split over two pages
\newpage
	\item Interface will accommodate users with certain common disabilities:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Components in which color is significant to gameplay will use 
			a color-blind friendly palette
		\item Components in which sound is significant to gameplay will have
			corresponding text and/or visual indicators to accommodate deaf users
		\item Avoid presenting bright flashing colors/lights that may trigger
			epileptic users
		\item Avoid sudden loud or unpleasant sounds that may disturb users with
			auditory sensitivities
		\end{itemize}
	\item Game will run on Windows and Mac computers
	\item Game will perform smoothly on standard hardware
	\item Game will present efficiency metrics to the player after they successfully 
		solve a puzzle
\end{enumerate}
