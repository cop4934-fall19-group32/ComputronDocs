\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Be a playable video game
	\item Help users learn and understand foundational computer science 
		concepts
	\item Have an easy to use 2D interface to encourage beginners
	\item Present the user with various challenges and puzzles to solve
	\item Provide beginner level explanations to concepts as they’re introduced
	\item Display visuals to help users understand concepts that are being introduced
	\item Encourage user to apply concepts to solve subsequent challenges once it has
		been introduced
	\item Supply hints to user when requested
	\item Allow user to see their previous solution attempts for a level
	\item Simulate the execution of player’s solutions with animated visuals
		corresponding to the steps
	\item Inform player of the accuracy and efficiency of their solution
	\item Give generalized feedback on the effifciency and space complexity of a solution
	\item Permit user to speed up the simulations
	\item Halt solution simulation in the case of:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Incorrect Output
		\item Runtime Error
		\end{itemize}
	\item Support scalability so additional levels can be added later on
	\item Interface will be suitable for users with certain common disabilities:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Color blindness
		\item Deafness
		\item Epilepsy
		\item Auditory stimuli sensitivities
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Demonstrate concepts visually with 2D animations simulating the 
		execution of a user’s solution to a challenge
	\item Allow user to select levels
	\item Design a simple pseudo-language with restricted capabilities for the
		user to solve challenges
	\item Interpret the set of commands in a user’s solution
	\item Solutions must follow interpreter requirements in order to be simulated
		(similar to compile time errors)
	\item Simulation will detect errors and halt immediately if an error
		is encountered (similar to runtime errors)
	\item Store user’s solution attempts for a level
	\item Evaluate the space complexity of a solution by tracking the data
		structures used
	\item Interface will accommodate users with certain common disabilities:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Components in which color is significant to gameplay will use 
			a colorblind friendly palette
		\item Components in which sound is significant to gameplay will have
			corresponding text and/or visual indicators to accommodate deaf users
		\item Avoid presenting bright flashing colors/lights that may trigger
			epileptic users
		\item Avoid sudden loud or unpleasant sounds that may disturb users with
			auditory sensitivities
		\end{itemize}
	\item Run on Windows and Mac computers, as well as Linux subsystems
	\item Perform smoothly on standard hardware
	\item Present efficiency metrics to the player after they successfully 
		solve a puzzle
	\item Personally identifiable information about users will not be collected or stored
\end{enumerate}
