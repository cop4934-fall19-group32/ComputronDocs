This section of the document describes the major milestones of our project. It
is highly susceptible to change.

\subsection{Big Prototype Party (Monday, Oct 14th)}

\subsubsection*{Summary}
Since this project does not have a sponsor, the onus is on us to determine the
exact nature of the problem we would like to solve. To ensure that our efforts
are directed effectively for the remainder of our project, our first month has
been dedicated to researching and playtesting. By this date, every member of the
team should have a solid foundation of the problem space we are working in, and
have a prototype of a solution.

\subsubsection*{Deliverables}
Every member of the team must have a prototype of our final game. This prototype
should fit the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The prototype is interactive.
  \item The prototype is engaging to work with.
  \item The prototype represent a wide slice of the game’s mechanics.
  \item The prototype makes the player think computationally.
  \item The rules of the prototype are concise and written out.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Game Pitch (Friday, October 18th)}

\subsubsection*{Summary}
This milestone culminates one of the most critical stages of our project. Now
that we’ve had the time to demonstrate non-abstractly what our problem space is
and how we’d like to solve it, we can converge on a unified solution. By this
milestone the team should be able to confidently answer the following questions,
and develop the documentation necessary to capture our answers:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What will our final product look like?
  \item What are the learning objectives of our game?
  \item What kind of puzzles will our game have?
  \item How will those puzzles work?
  \item How will those puzzles achieve our learning objectives?
  \item How will we order these puzzles to ensure that there is an appropriate
  learning curve?
  \item What evidence do we have that our learning curve will be engaging and
  effective for our target audience?
  \item What games did we draw inspiration from?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Deliverables}
This milestone’s deliverables are still non-code items. These are items that we
will rely on for the remainder of our project, and inform all future efforts.
Specifically, we must deliver:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A unified prototype of our final game
  \item A write up of our prototype, its capabilities, and its design philosophy
  \item Diagrams/concept drawings of game mechanics not demonstrated by the prototype
  \item Research Papers that support our design choices
  \item Playtesting findings that support our design choices
  \item Any other artifacts necessary to answer the questions above
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Paper Prototype 2.0 (Monday, October 28th)}

\subsubsection*{Summary}
Rapid iteration is an important part of successfully designing a game. By this
milestone, our original prototype should be placed in the hands of as many
playtesters as possible. The group should use the data from this playtesting to
inform any design changes we make to our prototype.

\subsubsection*{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A new prototype of our final game, with documentation supporting our
  changes to our original prototype.
  \item Expanded design documentation to capture the vision of our final game
  including:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Detailed system diagrams that describe how the mechanics of our game
    interact
    \item An explanation of who will be the lead on certain areas of our game
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hello Game (Wednesday, Dec 4th)}

\subsubsection*{Summary}
This milestone marks our the delivery of our proof of concept prototype. The teams advisor will evaluate the prototype and provide reccommendations for moving forward. The prototype will show an extremely basic vertical slice of our final game. 

\subsubsection*{Deliverables}
The only deliverable for this milestone will be the Hello World prototype. This prototype should meet the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Usability
  
  The prototype shall show the entire scene flow of our game. A user should be able to move between the Main Menu, Puzzle Selection, and Puzzle scenes at will. The game should respond to these requests gracefully, and never leave the user trapped in a scene. 

  \item Game Mechanics

  The foundations of the game's major mechanics should be in place and interactable, and are specified below by scene.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Main Menu
    
    The Main Menu scene should display the game's working title \textbf{\textit{Computron}}, as well as a functional Play Button that will bring the user to the Puzzle Selection Scene. The scene should also have a placeholder background image.

    \item Puzzle Selection Scene
    
    The Puzzle Selection Scene should display a placeholder level graph, with selectable nodes. Each node should transfer the player to the Puzzle Scene. The player should also be able to return to the main menu.

    \begin{figure}[!hb]
      \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=5cm]{HelloWorldLevelSelect.png}
        \caption{Sample level graph.}
        \label{fig:boat1}
      \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    \item Puzzle Scene
    
    The Puzzle Scene will be the most involved portion of our prototype. Desired mechanics are listed below by discipline:\\

    \textbf{UI:} The Puzzle UI will need to allow the player to perform the basic puzzle solving operations. It should present the player with an instruction set (\textit{Input, Output}) from which they may drag instructions into a solution window. The Puzzle UI should present controls to allow the player to begin and terminate the simulation of their solution. When the player's solution is being executed, the UI should prohibit alterations to the solution window and display a program counter to mark the current instruction being executed.\\

    \textbf{Level Design:} The level design of the Puzzle Scene will present all of the static elements that will be present in every puzzle of our game. It will display an input box with randomly generated contents, an output box that can accept objects from the actor, and a simple background plate.\\

    \textbf{Puzzle Logic:} Working in tandem with the level design, the puzzle scene's logic system should be operational. Puzzle Logic is responsible for loading the scene with the appropriate puzzle information. This includes a randomly generated input box, the level prompt, an expected output, and the logic to read the output box upon program completion to grade the player's solution.\\
    
    \textbf{Interpreter:} The interpreter is the glue that binds the UI controls to the Actor system. For this milestone, the Interpreter should be able to access and process the player's solution stored in the solution window. When the player starts the simulation the Interpreter should process the instructions (ensuring none are malformed) and make them available to the actor upon request. When the actor requests an instruction, the interpreter will update it's program counter accordingly and report the counter's new position to the UI. The Interpreters PC calculation should be fully operational for the Input, Output, and Unconditional Jump commands\\

    \textbf{Actor:} For this milestone, the actor should be able to query the interpreter for instructions to execute and interact with static level elements. Upon receiving an input command, the Actor should move to the input box and remove at item. The currently held item should be displayed on the Actor. Upon receiving an output command, the Actor should move to the output box and deposit the currently held item. If the actor does not have an item in hand, it should report a fault to the interpreter so that simulation can be halted. If the actor see's two input commands back to back, it should discard its currently held item and attempt to take from the input box again.\\
    
  \end{itemize}

  \item Art
  
  For this milestone programmer art placeholders are acceptable. However, the team should have a plan in place to aquire quality art assets.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Waterfall Method (Thursday, December 5th)}

\subsubsection*{Summary}
This milestone marks the end of Senior Design 1. As such, we are required by the
class to produce a document that outlines all of our plans for Senior Design 2.
This document will describe all the intricacies of our project.

\subsubsection*{Deliverables}
As per the requirements of this course, our final design document will describe
all aspects of the project including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Our initial research
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We will satisfy this requirement through our findings in published
    research, as well as our findings through playtests of our game and others
  \end{itemize}
  \item Personal Motivations
  \item Broader Impacts
  \item Design
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Our design will rely heavily on our initial research findings, and
    include a wide range of diagrams.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Theory of Operation
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Our theory of operation will best be conveyed through the paper
    prototypes we produced in the early stages of our project. Therefore, our
    final design document should include extensive write ups of those prototypes.
  \end{itemize}
 \item Implementation methodology
 \item Milestones
 \item Testing
 \begin{itemize}
   \item The testing of our project will be difficult due to the nature of game
   programming. In industry, many studios forgo unit testing of non-engine code.
   We will need to come up with a rigorous set of manual tests, as well as a
   consistent playtesting schedule to ensure our game remains in a functioning
   state.
 \end{itemize}
 \item Final Performance/Results
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Open to Interpretation (Monday, January 10th)}

\subsubsection*{Summary}

have an expanded prototype of our game. It still may be rough around the edges,
but it should demonstrate that we are capable of carrying this project out by
the end of the semester.

\subsubsection*{Deliverables}
A player should be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Start the game

    \end{itemize}
    \item Handles logical errors
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Conditional Jumps with empty hand
      \item Move/Copy from empty register
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Turing Complete (Friday, February 7th)}

\subsubsection*{Summary}
For the previous milestone we laid the foundations for our most important
instructions. For this milestone, we should have these fundamental instructions
in a highly polished state. This includes all the messaging necessary to
indicate the operations being performed, and well as robust error handling and
reporting.

\subsubsection*{Deliverables}
A polished demo that demonstrates the most fundamental instructions of our game.
The requirements for each instruction are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Input
  \begin{itemize}
    \item When the input command is executed, the Actor should travel to and
    grab data from the input bin.
    \item The input bin should react to having an input extracted
    \item The Actor should display the item it picked up
  \end{itemize}
  \item Output
  \begin{itemize}
    \item When this command is executed, the Actor should travel to the output box
    and drop the item in its hands
    \item If the actor’s hands are empty, the program should terminate and alert
    the player
    \begin{itemize}
      \item This requires the actor to emote in response to the error
      \item The user interface should draw the player’s attention to the issue
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Unconditional Jumps
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Unconditional Jumps should properly work properly.
    \item The user should be able to easily create loops
    \item The user should be able to easily skip instructions
  \end{itemize}
  \item Conditional Jumps
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Conditional jumps should have all the proper messaging to indicate
    their function
    \item If the actor’s hands are empty, the program should terminate and alert
    the player
    \begin{itemize}
      \item This requires the actor to emote in response to the error
      \item The user interface should draw the player’s attention to the issue
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Register Manipulation
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Players should be able to play register memory cards before running
    their solution, and see their instructions place and remove items from those
    registers.
    \item If the player performs an invalid instruction pertaining to register
    manipulation, the program should terminate and alert the player
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The actor should emote to signal the error
      \item The UI should draw attention to the error
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Advanced Puzzles (Friday, February 28th)}

\subsubsection*{Summary}
For this milestone, we would like to expand our memory card system to include
several fundamental data structures that can allow players to solve increasingly
complex problems. For our initial offering, we would like to support Stacks,
Heaps, and Queues.

\subsubsection*{Deliverables}
TBD

\subsection{Opening Sequence (Friday, March 20th)}

\subsubsection*{Summary}
By this milestone, we should have a complete tutorial sequence to our game. This
will make it appropriate for intense playtesting and refactoring.

\subsubsection*{Deliverables}
We should be able to deliver an early draft of our puzzle game that includes a
tutorial sequence, with all the appropriate messaging. A player should be able
to sit down and complete this sequence \textbf{without any input from developers}.
This tutorial sequence includes a series of very simple puzzles to orient
players with the instruction set at their disposal.

A Player from our target demographic should be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Arrive with no prior experience to the game
  \item Complete all the puzzles in the series without getting frustrated
  \item After completing the tutorial sequence, be able to make a confident
  attempt at a more difficult puzzle
\end{enumerate}

To achieve this we will need:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A system for presenting levels in linear fashion (A world map)
  \item A system for messaging the player in a non-obtrusive way
  \item In-game accessible documentation for all of our basic instructions
  \item Robust entity to act out player instructions
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Animated
    \item Responsive
    \item Emotive
  \end{itemize}
  \item A somewhat polished User Interface for creating and running puzzle scripts
  \item A bug-free interpreter
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Good luck with that :’(
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Playtesting Results}
\subsubsection*{Summary}
After we have a viable set of puzzles, it is very important to get our game in
front of as many people as possible. This milestone marks the end of our
playtesting sprint, after which we can plan and make changes to improve the
player experience.
\subsubsection*{Deliverables}
A set of playtesting data, and a list of refactorings we’d like to make to
improve the game.

\subsection{Final Product}
\subsubsection*{Summary}
This is our final milestone, therefore, we should be done with the project.
\subsubsection*{Deliverables}
A game that doesn’t suck.
