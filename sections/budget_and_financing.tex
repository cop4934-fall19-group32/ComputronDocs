As a student-sponsored team, Group 32 has no financial support. Fortunately all of 
the tools we have decided to use to make \textit{Computron} are either free or available 
to students free of charge. Unfortunately, the nature of the licenses for some of our 
tools is highly restrictive, which could pose a risk to the team in the future.\\

Below is a table of the software tools we are using, the tool's cost to the team, and
 any licensing risks we are monitoring for that tool.
